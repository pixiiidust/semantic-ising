# Semantic Ising Simulator (Alpha Ver.)

A multilingual semantic Ising model simulator that: 
* explores how semantically identical words across languages potentially converge in their embedding space under Ising dynamics. 
* visualizes multilingual alignments to reveal latent structure approaching critical temperature.

## üéØ Overview

* Do words meaning "dog" in 70+ languages share a common latent semantic structure? 
* Using Ising model dynamics, we simulate semantic phase transitions and detect critical temperatures where universal semantic patterns emerge.
* Inspired by the **Platonic representation hypothesis** 

**Key Questions:**
- Do semantically identical words across languages converge in embedding space?
- What is the critical temperature where semantic phase transitions occur?
- How do anchor languages relate to emergent multilingual semantic structures?

## üî¨ Experimental Designs

Two modes to study multilingual semantic structure:

### **Single-Phase Mode** (`include_anchor=True`)
**Question**: "Does the anchor language share semantic space with other languages?"
- Anchor participates in Ising dynamics with all languages
- **Use when**: You want to see how anchor influences collective dynamics

### **Two-Phase Mode** (`include_anchor=False`)
**Question**: "How does the anchor compare to the emergent multilingual structure?"
- Anchor excluded from dynamics, compared to result at critical temperature
- **Use when**: You want to test anchor alignment with emergent structure

#### üìä **Key Differences**
- **Single-Phase**: Higher Tc, anchor visible in UMAP
- **Two-Phase**: Lower Tc, anchor highlighted separately in UMAP

## üß† Scientific Background

### Ising Model for Semantics

The simulator applies statistical physics concepts to semantic analysis:

- **Vectors as Spins**: Word embeddings represent "spins" in semantic space
- **Temperature Control**: Higher T = more randomness, Lower T = more alignment
- **Phase Transitions**: Critical temperature (Tc) marks emergence of universal structure
- **Correlation Length**: Characteristic scale of semantic correlations

### Key Metrics

- **Alignment**: Average cosine similarity between vectors (0-1 scale)
- **Entropy**: Shannon entropy of vector distribution
- **Correlation Length**: Characteristic length scale of correlations
- **Cosine Distance**: Primary semantic distance metric for anchor comparison (0-1, lower is better)
- **Cosine Similarity**: Directional similarity for anchor comparison (0-1, higher is better)

### Phase Transition Detection

- The simulator now detects the critical temperature (Tc) using the log(Œæ) derivative method: Tc is identified as the temperature where the correlation length (Œæ) collapses (the "knee" in the plot). This is more robust and physically meaningful than previous alignment-based or Binder cumulant methods.

- All UI and analysis now annotate Tc at the knee, matching physical expectations.

---

## üìù Recent Improvements

- UI and backend are now tightly synchronized for critical temperature (Tc) display: the value shown in the UI and the vertical line in charts are always consistent.
- The convergence summary chart now only shows the vertical Tc line, improving clarity.
- Anchor comparison and simulation tabs have been cleaned up for a more professional, user-friendly experience.
- All debug output has been removed from the user interface.
