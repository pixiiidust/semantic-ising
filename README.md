# Semantic Ising Simulator (Alpha Ver.)

A multilingual semantic Ising model simulator that: 
1. Explores how semantically identical words across languages potentially converge in their embedding space (under Ising dynamics). 
2. Visualizes multilingual alignments to reveal latent structure as the system approaches a critical threshold.

## üéØ Overview

Do words meaning "dog" in 70+ languages share a common latent semantic structure? 
* Using Ising model dynamics, we simulate semantic phase transitions by detecting critical temperatures
* Critical temperatures denote alignment thresholds for embedded multilingual spaces, where universal semantic patterns may emerge
* This speculative approach is inspired by the **Platonic representation hypothesis** 

**Key Research Questions:**
1. Do semantically identical words across languages converge towards a universal embedding space?
2. What is the critical temperature where semantic phase transitions occur?
3. How do anchor languages relate to emergent multilingual semantic structures?

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Simulator Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 3. Configure Your Experiment

#### üìÑ Ensure Correct File Formats

  ##### **JSON Structure Example:**
```json
{
  "en": "dog",
  "es": "perro",
  "fr": "chien",
  "de": "hund",
  "it": "cane",
  "pt": "cachorro",
  "ru": "—Å–æ–±–∞–∫–∞",
  "zh": "Áãó",
  "ja": "Áä¨",
  "ko": "Í∞ú"
}
```
  ##### **File Naming Convention:**
- **Standard format**: `{concept}_translations_25.json` (25 languages)
- **Extended format**: `{concept}_translations_75.json` (75 languages)

  ##### **File Properties:**
- **Encoding**: UTF-8
- **Format**: Valid JSON
- **Language codes**: ISO 639-1 standard
- **Translations**: Single words or short phrases

  ##### **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitation:**
- **Current version only supports the same concept across different languages**
- Each JSON file must contain translations of the **same semantic concept** (e.g., all words meaning "dog")
- **Do not mix different concepts** in the same file (e.g., mixing "dog" and "tree" translations)
- The system assumes all translations in a file are semantically equivalent for proper Ising dynamics analysis

### 4. Usage Steps

1. **Select Concept**: Choose a concept (e.g., "dog", "tree", "love") or upload your own concepts
2. **Set Temperature Range**: Use auto-estimate (recommended) or set manually (0.1-5.0)
3. **Configure Anchor**: Choose anchor language and include/exclude from dynamics
4. **Run Simulation**: Click "Run Simulation" and watch the magic happen!

## üî¨ Experimental Designs

Two modes to study multilingual semantic structure:

### **Single-Phase Mode** (`include_anchor=True`)

**Question**: "Does the anchor language share semantic space with other languages?"
- Anchor participates in Ising dynamics with all languages
- **Use when**: You want to see how anchor influences collective dynamics

### **Two-Phase Mode** (`include_anchor=False`)

**Question**: "How does the anchor compare to the emergent multilingual structure?"
- Anchor excluded from dynamics, compared to result at critical temperature
- **Use when**: You want to test anchor alignment with emergent structure

#### üìä **Key Differences**

- **Single-Phase**: Higher Tc, anchor visible in UMAP
- **Two-Phase**: Lower Tc, anchor highlighted separately in UMAP

## üß† Scientific Background

### Ising Model for Semantics

The simulator applies statistical physics concepts to semantic analysis:

- **Vectors as Spins**: Word embeddings represent "spins" in semantic space
- **Temperature Control**: Higher T = more randomness, Lower T = more alignment
- **Phase Transitions**: Critical temperature (Tc) marks emergence of universal structure
- **Correlation Length**: Characteristic scale of semantic correlations

### Key Metrics

- **Alignment**: Average cosine similarity between vectors (0-1 scale)
- **Entropy**: Shannon entropy of vector distribution
- **Correlation Length**: Characteristic length scale of correlations
- **Cosine Distance**: Primary semantic distance metric for anchor comparison (0-1, lower is better)
- **Cosine Similarity**: Directional similarity for anchor comparison (0-1, higher is better)

### Phase Transition Detection

- The simulator now detects the critical temperature (Tc) using the log(Œæ) derivative method: Tc is identified as the temperature where the correlation length (Œæ) collapses (the "knee" in the plot). This is more robust and physically meaningful than previous alignment-based or Binder cumulant methods.

- All UI and analysis now annotate Tc at the knee, matching physical expectations.

- **Convergence Analysis**: Enhanced convergence summary with entropy vs correlation length visualization
- **Professional UI**: Cleaner, more user-friendly interface with improved explanations and removed debug output
